Antora documentation generation requires multiple tools to be set up properly.
Hosting static documentation is either simple or hard depending on the availability of a HTTP server.

This docker image solves both issues by

* generating the documentation during the `docker build`,
* hosting the generated documentation by `docker run`.

This image is especially useful for enterprise environments where

* highly regulated CI/CD pipelines doesn't allow special software to be installed,
* static file host is rare but container orchestration like kubernetes are common.

== Usage
Simply use this image as base image (`FROM`) in your Dockerfile with the standard Antora layout.

[WARNING]
.ONBUILD
====
This images has `ONBUILD` instructions hence the `-onbuild` prefix.

The `ONBUILD` instruction makes commands run during the build of the child image.

.Directory Layout
----
ðŸ“’ repository
  ðŸ“„ Dockerfile <.>
  ðŸ“„ antora-playbook.yml <.>
  ðŸ“‚ docs <.>
    ðŸ“„ antora.yml
    ðŸ“‚ modules
      ðŸ“‚ ROOT
----
<.> Dockerfile using this image as base.
<.> Standard `antora-playbook.yml` file.
<.> Standard Antora layout in the `docs` directory. This can be configured in the playbook.

.Dockerfile
[Dockerfile]
----
FROM inrigo/antora-onbuild <.>
----
<.> Use this images as base.

The base image's `ONBUILD` will

* copy all files from the context (root of the `Dockerfile`) to the `/antora` directory,
* run the `antora antora-playbook.yml` command,
* copy the generated site to the HTTP server's public directory.

The `.dockerignore` file can be used to exclude files from the copy command.

.Command line
[bash]
----
docker build . -t project_docs <.>
docker run --rm -d -p 9999:80 project_docs <.>
----
<.> Generates the documentation and adds it to the image.
<.> Serves the pre-generated documentation on the host at the `http://localhost:9999` URL.

=== Examples
Examples can be found in the link:test/[] directory.

* The link:test/local_docs/[local documentation] is the standard usage.
* The link:test/non_root/[non-root] is a usage when the Docker file must have the `USER <uid>` instruction as per vulnerability requirement.
* The link:test/base_image/[base image] shows how to use a child of this image as a base. This is usually hard as `ONBUILD` takes effect on the child only.

== Configuration
The HTTP server will run on the port `80` and it can be exposed to the host by the `-p <desired port>:80` argument.

[WARNING]
.Extension types
====
Please note that asciidoc and antora extensions are different, and they must be configured in their respective sections.
====

=== Kroki Server (Diagram Generation)
The image contains a Kroki server running on `http://localhost:8000`,
and the `asciidoctor-kroki` asciidoc extension installed.
This can be used to generate diagrams during the `docker build`.

.antora-playbook.yml
[yml]
----
asciidoc:
  extensions:
    - asciidoctor-kroki <.>
  attributes:
    kroki-server-url: http://localhost:8000 <.>
    kroki-fetch-diagram: true <.>
----
<.> The `asciidoctor-kroki` extension must be enabled.
<.> The url of the embedded Kroki server.
<.> This is mandatory as the embedded Kroki server is not exposed.

=== Lunr Antora Extension (Offline Search)
The image has the `@antora/lunr-extension` antora extension installed.

.antora-playbook.yml
[yml]
----
antora:
  extensions:
    - require: "@antora/lunr-extension"
----

== Known limitations
* The size of the image is big (~300 MB). This can be reduced by using docker multi-stage build.
* The Kroki extensions are not installed. Only the basic Kroki functionality is supported.
* Build, test, and release is done manually.

== Contribution
The `build.sh`, `test.sh` and `release.sh` help the development.

The test cases are located in the `test/` directory.
